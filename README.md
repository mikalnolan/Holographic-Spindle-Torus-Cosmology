## Overview

This work develops a **holographic cosmology on a spindleâ€“torus base**, grounded in a rigorous mathematical notion of **threads**â€”enhancements of fiber density in measured bundles. By weighting holographic projection with thread structure, the model yields emergent spacetime curvature and new perspectives on cosmic evolution.
