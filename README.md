## Overview

This work develops a **holographic cosmology on a spindleâ€“torus base**, grounded in a rigorous mathematical notion of **threads**â€”enhancements of fiber density in measured bundles. By weighting holographic projection with thread structure, the model yields emergent spacetime curvature and new perspectives on cosmic evolution.

## Key Ideas

- **Measured Bundles & Threads**  
  Threads are defined as localized enhancements of fiber density, invariant under trivialization.  

- **Thread-Weighted Projection**  
  Microscopic fields on the spindleâ€“torus (or hypertorus) base project into bulk fields, weighted by thread density.  

- **Emergent Curvature**  
  Variations and singularities in fiber density act as effective sources of curvature and stress-energy.  

- **Cosmological Scenarios**  
  - **Big Bang** modeled as a singular thread  
  - **Accelerated Expansion** from slow growth of thread density  
  - **Cyclic Universes** from time-varying concentration of threads  

- **Observational Signatures**  
  Predictions include power-spectrum turnover, small-scale damping, anisotropies aligned with threads, and CMB topology effects.

## Abstract

We unify a rigorous notion of threadâ€”a coordinate-free enhancement of fiber density in a measured bundleâ€”with a holographic cosmology on a spindleâ€“torus base. Threads act as invariantly defined loci of enhanced density that weight holographic projection, imprinting bulk fields with curvature and anisotropy. The framework models big bang conditions, late-time acceleration, and possible cyclic scenarios, while suggesting distinctive observational signatures.
